# OtagoStudentReview
Otago Student Review is a full stack web application group project. It is a service in which Otago students can view and leave reviews for papers they have taken at the university, university halls, and university tutors.

It is currently being developed as a Uni project and is not fully completed. We are currently using GitBucket not GitHub as the repository so will push here when possible.
